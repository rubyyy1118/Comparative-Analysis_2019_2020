# Economic Indicator Analysis 2019-2020

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the submission for Part B of the Data Analytics in Action module. The project focuses on analyzing economic indicators before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on GDP per capita, life expectancy, healthcare spending, population, CO2 emissions, and more. The analysis aims to understand the pandemic's global economic impact and offer data-driven insights for the UN public policy advisory.

### Part B Focus:
- Data cleaning and processing of 2019 economic indicators.
- Comparative analysis of economic changes between 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic year).

## 2. Files in this Repository

- `B_report.pdf`: The report for Part B including the database design and economic analysis.
- `B_code.ipynb`: The Python notebook for Part B, containing the data cleaning and visualization tasks.

## 3. Instructions for Running the Code

To run the Python notebooks (`B_code.ipynb`), ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

### Steps:
1. Install the necessary packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your local environment and run the cells sequentially to generate the outputs.

### Expected Outputs:
- Part B performs data cleaning on 2019 data and provides comparative visual analysis of 2019 and 2020 data.

## 4. Analysis Overview

### Part B:
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing data for CO2 emissions and healthcare spending were imputed using methods based on continent averages and external sources.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Visual comparisons between 2019 and 2020 highlight the significant impact of the pandemic on CO2 emissions, healthcare expenditure, and GDP per capita.
